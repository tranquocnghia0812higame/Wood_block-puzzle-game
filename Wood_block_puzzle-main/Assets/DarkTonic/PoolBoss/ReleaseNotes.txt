POOL BOSS PLUGIN - By Dark Tonic, Inc. (c) 2014 - 2017

-Code by Brian Hunsaker

-V 1.1.4 - PoolBoss check for "IsActive" slightly different now to fix another rare bug. Should not break anything though.
		 - PoolBoss has new checkbox for "Can Disabled Obj. Despawn" (defaults to false). If you need to be able to despawn a game object you have disabled, you must check that box. It is worse on performance because it doesn't only check "is the object enabled" so only use it if you must have the ability.
		 - Fixed: there is no garbage collection during Despawn now.
		 - Fixed: garbage collection issue in Pool Boss Spawn method.
		 - Change: Removed from API all "string prefabName" parameters since now the grabbing of prefab name is not doing any garbage collection.
		 - Added "keepParent" parameter to PoolBoss.Despawn, defaults to false. If you specify true, the Game Object you are despawning will stay where it is in the Hierarchy, disabled. Useful for things that screw up when activated under Pool Boss (UI components come to mind). To respawn one of that Pool item in the same position, use PoolBoss.Spawn and pass in the intended parentTransform.
 		 - If you want Pool Boss to have better performance and register in-Scene game objects so that they can be despawned with "DespawnAllOfPrefab" and show in the spawned count, attach PoolableInfo script to your in-Scene objects.
		 - Added extension methods to PoolBoss: OnLayer and WithScale. You can chain these with a Spawn call, like this: var spawned = PoolBoss.SpawnOutsidePool(ProjectilePrefab.transform, this.trans.position, Quaternion.identity).OnLayer(LayerMask.NameToLayer("IgnoreRaycasts")).WithScale(new Vector3(4,4,4));
		 - Changed the default: Now NavMeshAgent components on Pool Items are not automatically enabled on spawn. There is a new setting for Pool Items with NavMeshAgent to make it work as before.
		 - Added ORK Framework integration as an optional package.
		 - Added Makinom Framework integration as an optional package.

-V 1.1.3 - Cleaned up Garbage Collection.
		 - Bug fix: PoolBoss.NextPoolItemToSpawn returned null even when Allow Instantiate More is checked.
  		 - Added "Initialize Time (Frames)" field. Defaults to 1. Now you can configure how many frames it takes to create all pools. You can set it between 1 and the number of different prefabs you have in Pool Boss.
		 - Added peak indicator for each pool item, showing the max that were used at one time.
 		 - Added extension methods for all methods in PoolBoss that take a Transform parameter so you can call them from the Transform with 1 less parameter.
		 - Added PoolBoss.DestroyCategoryPoolItems and DestroyPoolItem methods, only to be used when loading a new Scene with a persistent PB.

-V 1.1.2 - Fixed compile errors in Unity 2017 beta.

-V 1.1.1 - Fixed compile error in Unity 5.5
		 - Fixed max qty mismatch in Pool Boss Inspector.
		 - Fixed error in PrefabIsInPool method.
		 - Fixed bug in PoolBossDespawn Playmaker Custom Action that would not despawn 2 different objects if the property changed.

-V 1.1   - Moved all classes into a namespace. If you are using code to call the API, you will need to add "using DarkTonic.PoolBoss;" at the top of those classes you use it in.
 		 - Fixed the namespace on Playmaker Custom Actions. If you are using these, you will need to re-import the new package or it will not compile.
	     - Added NextPoolItemToSpawn method which will give you the next available item in a pool.
		 - Removed random pool item selection. Now it always uses the first available.

-V 1.0.8 - Updated to the very latest in Core GameKit, complete with categories, spawned/despawned counts and more!

-V 1.0.7 - Fixed Unity 5.3 warning.

-V 1.0.6 - Fixed Unity 5.1 warning.

-V 1.0.5 - Fixed rare bug with Spawn not finding the item if despawned before.

-V 1.0.4 - Updated Playmaker custom actions. There was a compile error.

-V 1.0.3 - Add ability to spawn by name instead of passing in a Transform. This should prove useful when I get the Bolt Network compatibility working!
		 - Added drag area to create multiple items at once by dragging them into the box when locking the Inspector.
		 - Updated UI to look better. Matched with our other plugins' new UI colors and grouped boxes.

-V 1.0.2 - Fixed warnings in the Console that occur if you spawn and despawn elements with the new uGUI components.

-V 1.0.1 - All example files and Pool Boss prefab were broken. Meta files weren't set up in the project. Now fixed!

-V 1.0 - Submitted 10/21/2014 on the Asset Store
